# Quiz Generator

This Python program generates a simple True/False quiz. The application reads a series of questions and their correct answers from a predefined data source, presents them to the user one by one, and keeps track of the user's score.

## Features

- Presents True/False questions to the user.
- Tracks the user's score throughout the quiz.
- Displays the final score at the end of the quiz.



## Example

Here's a brief example of how the quiz works:

- The program displays: `Q.1: A slug's blood is green. (True/False)`
- The user inputs: `True`
- This process continues until all questions are answered.
- The program then displays the final score: `You have completed the quiz. Your final score is X/Y`
